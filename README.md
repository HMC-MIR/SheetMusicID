# SheetMusicID

This repository contains the code for the ISMIR 2020 paper "Camera-Based Piano Sheet Music Identification."

The goal of this project is to identify a page of piano sheet music given a cell phone picture of it.  Our main contribution is a novel hashing scheme called dynamic n-gram fingerprinting that allows us to search all piano IMSLP sheet music images in under a second with high retrieval accuracy.
